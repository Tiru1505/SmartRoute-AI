    Raise an alert on demand.

    The alerting path normally fires only when traffic actually deteriorates
    past the policy gates, which is the right behaviour and impossible to
    schedule for a live demonstration. This lets one be raised deliberately.
    It produces a genuine alert through the same service and storage as an
    automatic one — `trigger: "manual"` in its metadata is the only difference,
    so nothing here can be mistaken later for something the system detected.
