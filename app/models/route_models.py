    Rerouting is only meaningful part-way through a journey — the road already
    travelled cannot be re-decided — so `progress` says how far along the driver
    is. `spike` congests the road *ahead* of that point, which is what gives the
    demo something real to react to: without it the network is unchanged since
    the route was planned, and the honest answer is always "no better route".
