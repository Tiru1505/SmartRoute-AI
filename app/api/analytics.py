Analytics, scalability and multi-stop endpoints.

These three pages of the dashboard had nothing to call: the frontend requested
/analytics and /scalability, and both 404'd, so the Analytics page rendered
empty and the Benchmark page showed an empty table.

Everything here is served from the real optimisation engine. The heavy
endpoints (benchmark, scalability) are cached in-process because a full run
takes tens of seconds and the dashboard re-fetches on every visit.
