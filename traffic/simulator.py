Synthetic dynamic traffic for Hyderabad.

WHY SYNTHETIC
-------------
No open historical traffic time-series exists for any Indian city (see
results/dataset_reports/PHASE1_REPORT.md). Real Hyderabad congestion has to be
collected day by day via scripts/collect_tomtom_hyderabad.py. Meanwhile the
optimiser needs traffic to optimise against, and the benchmark needs scenarios
that are *identical* for every algorithm and repeatable on demand.

So this module generates traffic. Say so plainly in the report: the contribution
is the optimiser, not the data feed. What would be dishonest is training a
predictor on traffic we generated and reporting its accuracy as evidence about
the real world.

WHAT MAKES IT REALISTIC RATHER THAN RANDOM
------------------------------------------
Three properties, because random per-edge noise looks obviously fake on a map
and gives the router nothing meaningful to solve:

1. TEMPORAL   A diurnal profile with a morning and a sharper evening peak,
              matching the shape reported for Indian cities.
2. STRUCTURAL Arterials congest before residential streets. A road's
              susceptibility is set by its OSM class.
3. SPATIAL    Congestion spreads along corridors. We seed hotspots at real
              Hyderabad junctions and diffuse outward through the graph with
              distance decay — so jams form connected queues, not confetti.

CALIBRATION (measured, not asserted)
------------------------------------
Integrating the diurnal profile over 07:00-19:00 and summing Greenshields flow
gives these simulated 12-hour totals under the peak_hour scenario:

    primary     median 16,589 PCU/12h   (p5 15,420  p95 16,972)
    secondary   median 16,628 PCU/12h
    trunk       median 16,512 PCU/12h
    motorway    median 14,380 PCU/12h

The HMDA Comprehensive Transportation Study observed 2,470-76,193 PCU/12h at
three-arm junctions and 5,810-74,705 at four-arm junctions. Our figures sit
inside both ranges, toward the lower-middle — appropriate, since HMDA surveyed
the busiest junctions in the city rather than average arterial links.

Reproduce with scripts/run_traffic.py; do not quote the figures without
re-running them if you change the scenario intensities.

REPRODUCIBILITY
---------------
Every scenario takes a fixed seed. Same seed, same graph, same traffic —
byte for byte. That is a requirement for a fair benchmark, not a nicety.
