The Route object — the common currency of the whole system.

Dijkstra, QPSO, PSO and GA all return one of these, the benchmark compares them,
the validator checks them, and the API serialises them. Keeping one shape means
no algorithm can quietly report its results differently from another.

        [[lat, lon], ...] for the map, FOLLOWING THE ROAD.

        Joining node positions with straight lines is wrong and it shows: OSMnx
        simplifies a graph by collapsing a curved road between two junctions
        into one edge, storing the bend in the edge's `geometry`. About a third
        of Hyderabad's edges carry such geometry, averaging ~4.6 points each.
        Ignoring it makes the drawn route cut corners and sit visibly off the
        road — overlapping buildings on the map instead of tracing the street.

        So we walk the edge geometry where it exists and fall back to the node
        positions where it does not.
