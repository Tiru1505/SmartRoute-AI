Constrained routing — the experiment that justifies using a metaheuristic.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
    minimise    travel time
    subject to  congestion exposure <= B

"Congestion exposure" is metres weighted by congestion: driving 2 km on a road
that is 50% congested counts as 1 km of exposure. It is already tracked on
every Route as `congested_m`, so nothing new has to be measured.

Read the constraint as a driver's instruction: "get me there as fast as you
can, but I am not willing to sit in more than about 4 km worth of jam."

WHY DIJKSTRA CANNOT DO THIS
---------------------------
Dijkstra is optimal because of one property: the best route to a node is always
part of the best route through it. So once it settles a node it never looks at
that node again.

A budget destroys that property. Suppose there are two ways to reach
Mehdipatnam:

    route P   12 minutes, uses 3.5 km of the budget
    route Q   14 minutes, uses 0.8 km of the budget

Dijkstra settles Mehdipatnam with P — it is faster — and discards Q forever.
But if the remaining leg needs 2 km of budget, P leads to a dead end and Q was
the correct choice. Dijkstra has already thrown it away.

Formally this is the Resource-Constrained Shortest Path problem, and it is
NP-hard. This is the class of problem metaheuristics exist for.

THE HONEST BASELINE
-------------------
We do NOT compare QPSO against a strawman. The standard classical attack is
Lagrangian relaxation: fold the constraint into the edge weights as

    weight(e) = time(e) + lambda * congestion_exposure(e)

and sweep lambda. Each lambda gives an ordinary Dijkstra problem, and large
lambda buys feasibility at the cost of time. We run that sweep and keep the
best feasible route it finds.

That is a genuinely strong baseline. It cannot guarantee optimality — the best
solution reachable by ANY lambda can still be worse than the true constrained
optimum, and that shortfall is the duality gap — but a guarantee is not the
same as a large gap in practice.

MEASURED RESULT: LAGRANGIAN WINS. REPORT IT THAT WAY.
-----------------------------------------------------
Hitec City -> Charminar, peak_hour, 8 QPSO trials per budget:

    budget    Lagrangian    QPSO best    QPSO feasible    winner
    8.82 km      4.9967     no route          0/8         Lagrangian
    9.13 km      4.9967     no route          0/8         Lagrangian
    9.54 km      3.9096       4.6571          5/8         Lagrangian
   10.06 km      3.9096       4.4922          8/8         Lagrangian

Lagrangian relaxation beat QPSO at every budget level, by 15-19% on objective,
and at tight budgets QPSO could not find a feasible route at all.

Two things are nonetheless established, and both matter:

  1. PLAIN Dijkstra genuinely cannot solve this. It returns the fastest route,
     which breaks the budget, and has no mechanism to trade time for exposure.
     That part of the argument holds.

  2. But "Dijkstra cannot solve it" is not the same as "classical methods
     cannot solve it". Lagrangian relaxation is classical, cheap to implement,
     and on this instance class its duality gap is small enough that it
     dominates.

The cause of QPSO's shortfall is the waypoint encoding, characterised in
optimization/encoding.py: it already sits ~10% above the unconstrained optimum
under congestion, so it cannot be expected to win a constrained variant of the
same problem.

DO NOT present this as a QPSO victory. A negative result, honestly reported
with its cause identified, is worth more than a fabricated positive one — and
is what the project brief explicitly asks for.
