"""
Multi-stop routing — the problem where classical shortest-path methods stop
being applicable at all.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
    "Start at the depot, visit these N stops in any order, end wherever the
     last stop is (or return to the depot). Minimise total cost under current
     traffic."

A delivery van, an ambulance with several pickups, a waste-collection round.
This is the Vehicle Routing Problem — the exact thing the SIH problem statement
names when it says classical optimisation struggles because the problem is
NP-hard.

WHY DIJKSTRA AND LAGRANGIAN RELAXATION CANNOT DO THIS
-----------------------------------------------------
Not "do it badly" — cannot express it.

Dijkstra answers "cheapest path from A to B". It has no notion of ORDER. Given
five stops it cannot tell you which to visit first, because that question does
not exist in its formulation. Lagrangian relaxation does not help either: it
also only ever handles two endpoints; it merely reweights the edges between
them.

The number of orders is N! — 120 for five stops, 40,320 for eight, 3.6 million
for ten. That combinatorial explosion is the whole point, and it is where
metaheuristics are the appropriate tool rather than an ornament.

ENCODING: RANDOM KEYS
---------------------
Continuous optimisers cannot output a permutation directly. The standard bridge
is random-key encoding (Bean, 1994):

    vector      [0.72, 0.13, 0.55, 0.91, 0.30]
    argsort  -> [1, 4, 2, 0, 3]                  <- visit order

Sort the numbers; their ORIGINAL indices, in sorted order, are the tour. Every
vector in [0,1]^N maps to a valid permutation, so — as with the waypoint
encoding — there are no invalid candidates to repair.

It also means QPSO, PSO and GA all search exactly the same [0,1]^N box with the
same decoding. No algorithm gets an encoding advantage, which is what makes the
comparison fair.

SPEED
-----
Evaluating a tour needs the cost of travelling between stops. Those costs do
not change during a run, so we precompute the full stop-to-stop matrix once
with N+1 Dijkstra runs. After that, scoring a tour is N table lookups —
microseconds. This makes multi-stop far cheaper to set up than the single-pair
corridor encoding, not more expensive.
