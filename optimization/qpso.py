Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization — the core contribution of this project.

WHAT IT IS (and is not)
-----------------------
QPSO is a SEARCH ALGORITHM, not a machine-learning model. Nothing is trained.
We give it a road network and an objective, and it searches for a good route.

It is "quantum-INSPIRED", running on an ordinary CPU. It borrows one idea from
quantum mechanics as a sampling metaphor. Say this plainly and early — if a
judge thinks you are claiming a quantum computer, you lose credibility you
cannot win back.

THE IDEA, IN PLAIN TERMS
------------------------
Picture 30 searchers looking for the lowest point in a dark valley.

In ordinary PSO each searcher has a VELOCITY. They drift, steered by the best
spot they personally found and the best spot anyone found. Because they move in
steps, a searcher can get trapped behind a ridge: every small step uphill looks
worse, so nobody crosses it.

QPSO throws velocity away. It treats each searcher as a quantum particle, which
has no definite position — only a CLOUD of possible positions. Each iteration we
sample a new position from that cloud. Because the cloud has long tails, a
particle can appear on the far side of a ridge in a single step. That is why
QPSO escapes local optima more readily, and it is the honest one-sentence answer
to "why quantum-inspired?".

It also has fewer knobs: no velocity, no inertia weight, no two acceleration
constants. Just one contraction-expansion coefficient, beta.

THE UPDATE RULE
---------------
For particle i, dimension j:

    phi   ~ U(0,1)
    p_ij  = phi * pbest_ij + (1 - phi) * gbest_j        <- local attractor
    u     ~ U(0,1)
    L     = beta * |mbest_j - X_ij|                     <- cloud width
    X_ij  = p_ij  +/-  L * ln(1/u)                      <- quantum sample

  pbest  personal best position of this particle
  gbest  best position found by the whole swarm
  mbest  MEAN of every particle's personal best  <- unique to QPSO; it is what
         sets the cloud width, so the swarm contracts naturally as it agrees
  ln(1/u) comes from the delta potential well: u is uniform, so ln(1/u) is
         exponentially distributed and occasionally large. Those rare large
         jumps are the exploration mechanism.

beta decreases linearly from beta_start to beta_end across the run: wide clouds
early (explore), tight clouds late (refine).
