"""
The alert engine — deciding what is worth telling the driver.

THE HARD PART IS STAYING QUIET
------------------------------
A system that alerts whenever a marginally better route appears is worse than
one that never alerts at all: people learn to dismiss it, and then miss the
alert that mattered. The engineering here is mostly about suppression.

The rerouting engine decides what is TRUE. This module decides what is WORTH
SAYING. Keeping them separate means the thresholds below can be tuned — or
handed to the user as a setting — without touching the optimiser.

FIVE GATES, AND WHY EACH EXISTS
-------------------------------
1. ABSOLUTE SAVING     Saving 90 seconds on a 40-minute drive is not worth an
                       interruption. Default: 5 minutes.
2. RELATIVE SAVING     On a 3-hour delivery round, 5 minutes is noise. Requiring
                       a percentage as well as an absolute keeps the rule sane
                       across trip lengths. Default: 10%.
3. COOLDOWN            After any alert, stay silent for a while. Without this,
                       a slowly worsening jam produces a stream of alerts as the
                       saving creeps up. Default: 5 minutes.
                       With an ESCALATION OVERRIDE: if the saving has grown
                       2.5x since the last alert, speak anyway. A plain cooldown
                       suppressed savings of 15, 37 and 46 minutes in testing
                       because a 6-minute alert had just fired — which is
                       exactly when the driver most needs to hear from you.
4. REPEAT SUPPRESSION  If the driver declined this suggestion, do not ask again
                       unless the situation has materially changed — which we
                       define as the saving growing by half again. Nagging is
                       how a useful feature becomes an ignored one.
5. HYSTERESIS          Once rerouted, require a larger margin before rerouting
                       again. Prevents ping-ponging between two routes whose
                       ranking keeps flipping as traffic fluctuates.

Incidents and closures BYPASS gates 1-3: a closed road ahead is not a
suggestion, it is information the driver needs immediately.
