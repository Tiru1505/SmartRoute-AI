Make sure the road graph exists before the API starts.

WHY THIS RUNS AT STARTUP, NOT AT BUILD TIME
-------------------------------------------
On Railway and Render alike, a persistent volume is attached to the *running*
container, not to the build step. A build command that writes the graph to the
volume path writes into an ordinary directory that is then thrown away, and the
first request finds nothing. So this runs from the start command instead, once,
before uvicorn binds.

It is idempotent: if the graph is already on the volume it returns immediately,
so only the very first boot after provisioning pays the cost.

TWO WAYS TO GET THE GRAPH
-------------------------
QRO_GRAPH_URL   download a prebuilt .pkl. Fast (a couple of minutes for
                ~214 MB) and predictable. Preferred for hosting: build the
                graph once on a laptop, put it in any object store, set the
                variable.

(unset)         rebuild from OpenStreetMap with preprocessing/osm_processor.py.
                Self-contained, but it downloads and reprojects the whole
                Hyderabad metro extract, which is slow and memory-hungry — it
                can exceed the peak footprint of the API itself. Fine on a
                large instance, risky on a small one.

The graph is not in the repository because the GraphML is 575 MB and the
pickle 214 MB, both past GitHub's limit.
