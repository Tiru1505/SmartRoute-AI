"""
The multi-objective cost model — the single objective function every algorithm
minimises. Dijkstra, QPSO, PSO and GA all import this, which is what makes the
benchmark fair.

THE IDEA
--------
Each road segment has three costs that are measured in different units:

    travel time      seconds
    distance         metres
    congestion       "congested metres" = length x congestion  (0..1)

You cannot add seconds to metres. So we divide each by a REFERENCE value taken
from one specific route — the free-flow fastest route between the same two
points — which makes all three dimensionless:

    fitness(route) = w_t * (time     / T_ref)
                   + w_d * (distance / D_ref)
                   + w_c * (congested_metres / D_ref)

Congestion is normalised by D_ref as well, because congested-metres and metres
are the same unit. That means w_c trades off directly against w_d: at
w_c == w_d, driving one kilometre of fully jammed road costs the same as
driving an extra kilometre.

WHY THIS NORMALISATION
----------------------
Fitness becomes readable. The free-flow reference route scores exactly
w_t + w_d (0.7 in balanced mode, since its congestion is 0). A route scoring
1.4x that is 40% worse. The numbers mean the same thing for every
origin-destination pair, which is what lets you average across trials.

WHY IT STAYS ADDITIVE
---------------------
Every term is a non-negative per-edge quantity divided by a constant, so the
route fitness is exactly the sum of its edge costs. That is precisely the
condition Dijkstra requires to be optimal — which is why Dijkstra gives us
ground truth to measure the metaheuristics against.
